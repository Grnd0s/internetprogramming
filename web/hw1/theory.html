			<h1>How Is Steganography Implemented?</h1>
			<p>There are several different techniques for concealing data inside of normal files. </br>
			One of the most widely used and perhaps simplest to understand is the least significant bit technique, known commonly as LSB.</p>

			<p>This technique changes the last few bits in a byte to encode a message, which is especially useful in something like an image, where the red, green, and blue values of each pixel are represented by eight bits (one byte) ranging from 0 to 255 in decimal or 00000000 to 11111111 in binary.</br>
			</br>
			Changing the last two bits in a completely red pixel from 11111111 to 11111101 only changes the red value from 255 to 253, which to the naked eye creates a nearly imperceptible change in color but still allows us to encode data inside of the picture.</p>

			<small>This diagram shows two 4-pixel images in both color and binary values. Each block of binary represents the value of the corresponding pixel.</small>
			<p>
				The least significant bit technique works well for media files, where slightly changing byte values creates only slight imperceptible changes, but not so well for things like ASCII text, where a single bit out of place will completely change the character.
				That's not to mention the fact that data hidden using LSB steganography is also easy to detect if someone is looking for it.</p>
			<p>For this reason, there are a plethora of other steganography techniques out there, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. 
				Another far less detectable one is called the discrete cosine transform coefficient technique (I know, it's a mouthful), which slightly changes the weights (coefficients) of the cosine waves that are used to reconstruct a JPEG image.
