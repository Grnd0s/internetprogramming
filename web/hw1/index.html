				<h1>What Is Steganography?</h1>

				<p>Unlike encryption, where it's obvious that a message is being hidden, <br />
				steganography hides data in plain view, inside a file such as a picture. <br />
				As far as images are concerned, to anyone who isn't aware that it contains hidden data, it looks like just a normal, innocent picture.<br />
					Steganography is useful in situations where sending encrypted messages might raise suspicion, such as in countries where free speech is suppressed. <br />
					It's also frequently used as a digital watermark to find when images or audio files are stolen. And on a less practical note — it's just cool.

					Steganography is defined as "the art of hiding messages inside media files", in other words, it is the way in which we can hide any message (text, image, audio, …) inside any file (.mp3, .wav, .png, …). <br />
					This helps people to make sure that only those who know about the presence of the message can obtain it. <br />
					There are many different methods of performing steganography, but the most famous are the LSB (Least Significant Bit) ones. <br />
					This kind of method modifies the LSB of different bytes with a bit from the message that will be hidden.
