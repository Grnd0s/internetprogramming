				<h3>What Is Steganography?</h3>

				<p>Unlike encryption, where it's obvious that a message is being hidden, <br />
				steganography hides data in plain view, inside a file such as a picture. <br />
				As far as images are concerned, to anyone who isn't aware that it contains hidden data, it looks like just a normal, innocent picture.
					Steganography is useful in situations where sending encrypted messages might raise suspicion, such as in countries where free speech is suppressed. It's also frequently used as a digital watermark to find when images or audio files are stolen. And on a less practical note â€” it's just cool.
